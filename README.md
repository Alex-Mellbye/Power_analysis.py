# Power_analysis.py
A script I wrote for a work project. Simple code for statistical power analysis. This code produces both an estimate of required sample sizes and power level. I rerun the code six times for six different variables separated into two groups called T1 and T3 (which is Time 1 and Time 3 - as there are different time points in the data)
